## Project Overview
In this project, you will implement a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using PyTorch to predict Airfoil Self-Noise. The provided Jupyter notebook (`code.ipynb`) serves as a template to guide you through the implementation.

### Problem Statement
Given 5 features (Frequency, Angle of attack, Chord length, Free-stream velocity, Suction side displacement thickness), your model should accurately predict the Scaled sound pressure level in decibels.
## Running the Code
1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook and run all cells.
3. Adjust hyperparameters and experiment with different configurations.
4. Save the notebook as a PDF and submit the zip file as per the guidelines.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- PyTorch
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- tqdm
